# Visualize Toronto Median Income by Neighbourhood with Tableau

[link to Tableau Project!] (https://public.tableau.com/profile/juanp5926#!/vizhome/TorontoIncomeByNeighbourhood/Sheet8?publish=yes)

# Project Description

This project was created by parsing through a csv file and an xlsx file that contains census data from 140 Toronto Neighbourhoods.
The CSV file contains 2015 data while the xlsx file contains 2000, 2005, 2010 data. 

# How To Run?

Libaries used within project include, Pandas, GeoPandas, Seaborn, Numpy. A full list of libraries will be included in the 
requirements.txt file. To install these packages simply type the following commad in your respective directory. 
  
   **pip install -r requirements.txt**

To run this project you will need to download the files within the TorontoData folder:
  - TorontoData.py
  - neighbourhood-profiles-2016.csv
  - neighbourhood-data-2001-2011.xlsx
  - Neighbourhoods.zip
  - You may will also need access to Tableau Public as this project is best displayed in Tableau. 
  
  Note: It is also possible to display the map using the MatplotLib Python libray instead of Tableau but it will not show as well. 
  I included the code for this if needed. it will be commented out in the python file.
