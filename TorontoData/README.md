[link to Tableau Project!] https://public.tableau.com/profile/juanp5926#!/vizhome/TorontoIncomeByNeighbourhood/Sheet8?publish=yes

# Project Description

This project was created by parsing through a csv file and an xlsx file that contains census data from 140 Toronto Neighbourhoods.
The CSV file contains 2015 data while the xlsx file contains 2000, 2005, 2010 data. 

Libaries used within project include, Pandas, GeoPandas, Seaborn, Numpy. A full list of libraries will be included in the 
requirements.txt file. To install all packages simply type the following commad in your respective directory. 
  
   **pip install -r requirements.txt**

To run this project you will need to download the files within the TorontoData folder which include:
  - neighbourhood-profiles-2016.csv
  - 
  - Neighbourhoods.zip
  - You may will also need access to Tableau Public as this project is best displayed in Tableau. 
  
  Note: It is also possible to display the map using the MatplotLib Python libray instead of Tableau but it will not show as well. 
  I included the code for this if needed. it will be commented out in the python file.
